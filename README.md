# theHorrorNerd01Portfolio
A WIP portfolio for my client's internet persona 'theHorrorNerd01'. This project is at a stall due to lack of communication from the client's end; therefore, this page is currently a landing page for what would be their future portfolio.

# Problems and Solutions

## Problem:
- Adding a noise-like animation to Theodore ('the Organ')

## Solution:
- Rather than messing with the complicated math behind the vectors defining the three.js models, I found it easier and arguably much better for performance to import openSimplexNoise.js

## Problem:
- Adding a text model to the three.js scene w/o sacrificing designability

## Solution:
- After much debate w/ myself, I found it best to learn a bit of blender and make use of the GLTFLoader available in three.js to import text models w/ custom designs


# Project Highlights
- Use of openSimplexNoise.js library to add animation to the Organ
- Use of three.js to make the entire scene and include animations
- Use of blender to create basic models w/ texturing and custom geometry
- Use of raycasting for adding a bit more UX capability into the landing page
